# 📊 Social Media Sentiment Analysis Project

## 📌 Overview
This project performs **Sentiment Analysis** on Twitter data using **Python, NLP (Natural Language Processing), NLTK, and WordCloud** for text cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization. The cleaned dataset is later integrated with **Power BI** for interactive dashboards, KPIs, and sentiment-based insights.
